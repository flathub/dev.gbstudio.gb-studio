    <p>GB Studio is drag and drop game creator for making Game Boy games</p>
    <p xml:lang="de">GB Studio ist ein Drag-and-Drop-Programm zur Erstellung von GameBoy-Spielen</p>
    <p>It is designed to be usable by people with little to no previous programming knowledge using simple visual scripting but also provides multiple access points for advanced users to access the game engine's virtual machine (GBVM) and to directly modify game engine's C and Z80 assembly code through plugins.</p>
    <p xml:lang="de">Es ist so designed, dass es auch von Personen mit geringen oder gar keinen Programmierkenntnissen mit Hilfe von einfachen visuellen Skripten verwendet werden kann. Es bietet aber auch fortgeschrittenen Benutzern mehrere Zugriffsmöglichkeiten auf die virtuelle Maschine der Spiel-Engine (GBVM) und die direkte Änderung des C und Z80-Assembler-Codes der Spiel-Engine durch Plugins.</p>
    <p>You can generate ROM files that can be run in an emulator, on a web page or on real Game Boy hardware</p>
    <p xml:lang="de">Du kannst ROM-Dateien erzeugen, die in einem Emulator, auf einer Webseite oder auf echter GameBoy Hardware ausgeführt werden können</p>
